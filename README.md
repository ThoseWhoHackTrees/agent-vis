# Space Agents!

A 3D command center for agentic swarms. Renders your codebase as a galaxy and your AI agents as spaceships navigating it in real time.

## What it does

Space Agents! visualizes a live codebase as a spiral galaxy: files and directories become stars, and each AI agent is a spaceship flying between them. View what every agent is doing (reading, writing, editing), which files are hot, and how your project is structured at a glance.

Files are color-coded by type and scaled by size. Agents are labeled and color-matched for tracking. Hover over any star to see recent activity. Zoom, orbit, or let the camera fly on autopilot.

```

Claude Code hooks stream agent telemetry to the server, which relays it to the frontend over WebSockets. The frontend watches the filesystem directly via the Rust `notify` crate and renders everything with the Bevy game engine.

## Stack

- **Frontend:** Rust + Bevy
- **Server:** Rust + warp
- **Networking:** WebSocket (tungstenite)
- **FS watching:** notify crate
- **Rendering:** Custom bloom/glow, bevy_picking, bevy_fontmesh

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75+ ([rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))

### Build

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd agent-vis

# build both
cd frontend && cargo build
cd ../server && cargo build
```

### Run

**1. Start the server**

```bash
cd server
cargo run
```

**2. Start the frontend**

```bash
cd frontend
cargo run -- /path/to/your/project
```

This will model the file tree, watch for changes, and connect to the server for agent events.

## Controls

- **Auto mode** (default): camera orbits on its own
- **Manual mode**: arrow keys to rotate/zoom, W/S to adjust height
- **Hover** over any star to see recent file activity

## Development

```bash
# server with auto-reload
cd server && cargo watch -x run

# frontend (debug build, faster compiles)
cd frontend && cargo run -- /path/to/project

# verbose logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run -- /path/to/project
```
